-- STEPS TO CREATE A NEW STAGE TYPE --
--------------------------------------

There are 5 asset objects that make up a basic stage type:

1 Background
2 Frame
3 Floor
4 Wall
5 Box

STEP 1: Create new folders for your stage type in these dirs:
	- Sprites/stageAssets
	- Tile Sets
	
STEP 2: Duplicate the template files for each new folder:
	- Select all the files in Sprites/stageAssets/template/*, then right click and "Duplicate"
		- The files will be automatically selected, drag them into your new folder
		- Rename each file based on the naming pattern of the template files (it's p clear)
	- Do the same with Tile Sets/template/*
	
STEP 3: Add your stageType to the `globals` file at the top of the Scripts folder (name it whatever)

STEP 4: Create the asset map:
	- open scLoadStageRes ---- 

STEP 5: Load your new stageType:
	- open Obects/controller/oGameController, you'll see the line `StageType = stageTypes.*` 
		change the current stageType to your new one
	- push the play button!
